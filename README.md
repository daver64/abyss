# Abyss
Experimental cross-platform game framework.

# Dependencies
This project depends on GLFW and OpenGL. Other minor dependencies
are included in the source tree.

# Compiling
Download somewhere. Then...

`cd wherever-you-put-it`\
`mkdir build`\
`cd build`\
`cmake -G "Build System Of Choice" ../`\
( eg: on windows with msvc `cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ../` then `nmake` to build using nmake)\
It is strongly recommended to build in a specific build directory.\
if compilation is successful the executable will be in project-dir/bin.\
