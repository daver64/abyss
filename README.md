# abyss
Experimental cross-platform game framework.

# dependencies
This project depends on GLFW and OpenGL. Other minor dependencies
are included in the source tree.

#compiling
Download somewhere. Then...

`cd wherever-you-put-it  
`mkdir build  
`cd build   
`cmake -G "Build System Of Choice" ../  
( eg: on windows with msvc 'cmake -G "NMake NMakefiles" ../' then nmake to build)

if compilation is successful the executable will be in project-dir/bin.

Happy Tinkering
Dave :)
